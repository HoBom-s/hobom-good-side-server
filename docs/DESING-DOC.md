# Design Documentation
## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the design and architectural decisions made for the ProductCategory module. The system follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles and utilizes a combination of Use Case, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and other patterns to structure the code for maintainability, scalability, and testability.

## System Architecture
The system is composed of several layers and components:

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and delegates business logic to service classes.
- **Service Layer**: Coordinates the business logic by utilizing Use Cases.
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulate the application's core business logic and delegates logic to query, command bus.
- **Command Handlers**: Handle commands and interact with repositories to persist changes.
- **Query Handlers**: Handle read queries and provide data retrieval functionality.

## Conclusion
This design ensures that business logic is cleanly separated into different components, improving modularity and scalability. The use of DDD principles, CQRS, and Use Cases helps keep the system maintainable and testable. The modular architecture allows easy updates and changes without affecting the overall functionality.
